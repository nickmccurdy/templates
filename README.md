# Templates
A small collection of simple templates for popular languages, frameworks, and tools.

## Files
Name | Description
--- | ---
build.xml | a sample build file for Ant projects using Java
construction.html | a tiny placeholder page for sites that are under construction
cookies.js | a simple cookie script for JavaScript (see http://www.quirksmode.org/js/cookies.html)
index.html | a simple, valid HTML 5 template that links to all included JS and CSS files (check out the source for other cool stuff!)
reset.css | a CSS reset to avoid styling inconsistencies across browsers (see http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)

## Generators and References
Many frameworks and tools have built in generators for new projects. These can often be more helpful than templates, since many generators have configurable options.
